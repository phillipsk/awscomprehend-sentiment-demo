you know
 Let's grab two
 Passage of Scripture first Peter, Chapter one in Galatians, Chapter three
 First Peter one
 Galatians three
 God is good
 Look, you never see a neighbor is good to be here
 We're just moving forward and asking Lord to bless
 We know that he is able we're moving into an anniversary season
 We're looking forward to the Lord doing great things in our church
 We're asking him to help us to accomplish his purpose
 How many want to have, um, want tohave the church that God wants us to have? I don't want a church that serves my needs
 Uh, I want to come to church so that I can take care of God's business
 I don't want to be self centered, and I don't want the focus to be on me
 I believe that if I am seeking first to do the work that God has me to do in his kingdom, I believe the Scriptures, all things gonna work out
 Did your neighbors say it's gonna work out? So let's take a look at the scriptures
 Um, we've been studying Ah, the perfect laws of liberty
 We've been learning about natural law, human law and spiritual law
 We all know at this point that we do not serve a god that makes himself look bad in the eyes of the world
 He does not break rules to build relationships
 You have to acknowledge God does not do for you just because you call yourself a Christian and then leave somebody out who has greater needs than you because they don't call themselves a Christian
 It doesn't work that way
 God has lost spiritual loss that he has made available to the whole world
 He's got a Bible that is available toe everybody Annie as churches where people can go in worship and access the kingdom of God
 Uh, is not feeding back a little turned that you've got to turn one of these down, and there's a lot of feedback coming out of one of these
 So we learned about the relationship in these laws and the reason why we have to study spiritual law and so that we don't approach life from a hyper spiritual perspective and never achieve what we should achieve because we were ignorant
 The Bible teaches us people don't achieve, Jesus said
 They don't achieve because they don't know what they're doing
 You can't ask God to prosper you and you don't understand basic economics
 You can't do it
 It doesn't make sense
 You know, if God's in the I'm passing all blessings business, and you can just clean whatever you want
 How come somebody I don't claim to be doctors? What? Why? People of giggling? I'm sorry
 It's walk up in the hospital
 Say, Listen, I'm a child of God
 I serve the Lord, and I got told me I'm gonna be a doctor
 I'm gonna work in this hospital
 Miss Hale, that's fine
 As long as he send you to school first
 No, no, no, no
 I'm no, no, no
 I'm a child of God
 You know, I cleaned my miracle right now in the name of Jesus, he said my breakthroughs Come in, sing a praise song
 See how fast security don't handcuff you and take you to another part of the hospital Because you sound ridiculous
 Their natural laws, they're human laws
 There were spiritual laws
 Ah, child of God that understands these laws can prepare themselves for journeys
 Look at your neighbors
 I want to prepare myself
 So this is why you spend time in the church so you can be focused on what God wants you to do it in every season he can assign these tasks that require a little bit more than what you had in the last season
 And if you were faithful in the last season, then you're inspired toe overcome what you're going to face in the next season because you know that God has already done exceedingly and abundantly more than you ever thought to ask of him
 Some people that are faithful have faith that we define as crazy
 Now the world calls us peculiar because we start on journeys Will start, will still go back to school
 We'll get a g d will get into a junior college
 If we drop out of school, we'd get back in school
 If we lose a job, we get a job
 See way
 Don't follow the same patterns
 We take care of our Children way work on our marriage is we don't just toss him to the side
 We know when we're out of bounds on where inbounds had a great conversation
 One of my favorite students today I was a great conversation with I just want all He's such a good kid
 We're talking
 That's the one
 I let you hear the video
 So we're talking
 I had him in an advisory class and he took out his phone
 He said, Mister, I want to show you this evangelist in Puerto Rico and he put the guy on the guy who preaching the Spanish
 You know, I could feel the anointing so that he was and we both He was preaching out, and then he spoke in tongues, right? And I said, I said, You thieves in the guy's preaching a Spanish My Spanish ate that tight, but I know speaking in tongues, I said, That's awesome! Then he showed me the service what his mother is
 And then I said to him, He said, Yeah, he had a picture with him He said, Yeah, I'm in the ministry
 He's a He's a minute Youth ministry
 Getty breaches a little bit and he took a picture and he said, Uh, I said, Man, that's awesome, you know? So what does your father? I don't see your father in the pictures with your father, because I know you're probably so my father said he no one gonna do at the ministry, he said, Don't bring church in the house
 I said, What what? You mean your father doesn't go to church? He said, No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
 I said, Well, that's all right, man
 Just keep praying for him
 He said Not I saw my mother
 I see what you mean
 Who's all He's not
 My mother's in sin
 Hold
 Hold their breath for you
 No, My mom hasn't said they wouldn't she know she should've message and she wanted me and my sisters
 They've been he keeping with him
 We got three kids
 He day married
 They just laid it
 No, you know, she's industrious
 She's insane
 She go to Charlie Bush's
 And since she knows that we talked about it all the time, she says, Pray boys 12
 And I'm standing in teaching about spiritual law
 And this young boy said, No, no, the law's the law
 God's word is the law We talked about it
 Don't want here, not know she's insane
 She wouldn't marry him or she got to make a move
 I'm like, All right, brother, You didn't mean it too deep for me
 We let's just go back to YouTube box the preacher trying to get into this sort of 12 year old
 But people know the law
 People know God's loss, and when you run into God's laws, you realize, like God messing around with you
 You gotta do what God requires you to do if you're going to get the blessing that he asked for you
 Let's get into this ward
 Take a look at the handout
 Christianity is to be viewed as an eternal inheritance
 That's what Christianity is
 It's an inheritance
 It means God has reserved for people a lifestyle that opens the doors to greater blessings
 When you are receiving an inheritance, you have to show maturity before you be can be given the authority as you mature
 God releases more opportunities for you to grow and be blessed
 Look at you
 Never say neighbor
 You have to show maturity
 You have to show maturity
 That's that's how you get your blessing in Jesus Christ
 You have to show maturity
 You can't be a child
 You know what Children do
 This is what Children do
 Children get caught up in their environment
 Adults know this is a responsibility that I have Children don't have the same sense of responsibility that adults do
 Adults understand
 There's more down the road
 If I take it all now, I'm going create problems later
 First, Peter, turn your bodies with me
 The first Peter, Chapter one, Are you there? First Peter, Chapter one, beginning at verse three
 His of the Bible says blessed be the god and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which, according to his abundant mercy, half begotten us again
 So here it is
 Yes, he blessed us with natural life, but he's begotten us again into a lively hope By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
 So just a CZ we inherit our looks and our genes Naturally
 Jesus Christ has given us an inherited spiritually
 The inheritance that Jesus Christ gives us is incorruptible
 You can't do something in your sin that will cost you your inheritance
 Look at you
 They would say Neighbor never doubt God, you can't do something in your sin
 You you didn't do your not all
 You're not too bad
 You're not too broken
 Your life was into this
 There's no mental
 We talked about that
 There's no mental illness
 Let that hippocampus grow harm you in church on Sunday
 If you have the joy of the Lord and your faithful, no matter what comes into your life, God has promised you will have the victory if your faithful there's nothing you want
 You didn't smoke too much
 You're injuring toe before you know the Lord
 There's nothing that she did that could compromise
 It's right there in the world
 Look what it says
 An inheritance
 That's what Incorruptible, What is it? Undefiled? And that what will never fade away? It's reserved in heaven for you
 Why? Because you are in Verse five kept by the power of God
 How how you kept by the power of God
 You have to demonstrate I'm kept by the park
 Got because I believe No, no, no
 You have to demonstrate
 So you're kept by faith unto salvation ready to be revealed now when it says in the last time, you have to understand what he's saying
 What Paul is saying
 He's talking about his life, meaning, I understand that in this season I've got to be faithful, so God's inheritance can be revealed to me in the next season from faithful
 Now then I can expect to see a greater demonstration of God's off my spiritual inheritance in the future
 That's why when you when you don't go through faithfully in the prior season, you're going tohave to go through it again the right way
 I'll prove it to you
 Turn over the Galatians, Go backwards to Galatians chapter, Chapter three, Galatians, Chapter four Turn your Bibles in its Bible study
 We're gonna get into the handout
 I'm gonna prove it to you
 I'm a prove it to you Galatians chapter for you, with me when you haven't say amen Galatians Chapter four This is what it says Now I say that the air as long as he is, she is immature
 Do you all see that word right there? Childish, different Nothing from a servant though you have the authority and power to govern everything in God's kingdom
 You have the right to claim everything
 You have the right to pray against anything
 You have the right and the authority
 But what does it say if you're not mature? If you're not mature emotionally, If you're not mature, naturally if your house listen Listen to me
 Look at your pastor
 Look at your pastor
 If you can't govern your own natural life
 How can you govern a spiritually power if you can't get so listen
 Listen
 Don't try to convince me or anyone else that you have the power toe
 Pray things out of your home and you can't get the prayer on time
 The devil has you so fooled
 People are laughing at you
 You can't get to prayer on time in a church
 But you can pray and have God bless your whole outside
 That doesn't make any sense
 It makes no sense
 Life is about discipline
 Are you gonna pass the course? If you show up late every day, I'm gonna pass the course
 If you miss all the tests, you have to demonstrate a sense of discipline for the church is here to teach us how to govern our flesh
 That's why the church has these thes
 They're called standards
 That's my church
 Doesn't start when enough people get here
 You don't sing song
 Still enough people arrive
 Trust doesn't start when the pastor gets here and it doesn't stop when he gets here
 That's not how it works
 Church has to be planned
 Organized
 It doesn't be controlled, as in the direction we're responding to
 The spirit was showing the Lord will we recognize that you're moving us into another season
 We're proving that you can treat church the way that you choose
 How you gonna do church like you do your friends
 When I get there, we just start
 How you gonna do God like that? You can't even do only like that
 Go to the movie
 Pay toilets for the ticket when you walk in is nothing like Okay, All the tickets have come Start the movie
 Treat God like he's so little Like he's so small Like he's so insignificant When I get there, I get there when they how On a Sunday when you wake up you should govern yourself as like you're growing up like one day I will be responsible Local Paul puts it
 He says he says, because you you don't understand that in this season God is preparing you for the next season
 So all of your discipline's the way that you I remember
 I used to teach it with the way that you present yourself in in the worship
 You can't be weary eyed, drippy
 I'd drowsy ID
 You can't let your itchy brain Have you running in now? The sanctuary
 I go over this all the time because people act like I'm saying it like it bothers me
 It doesn't bother me
 I don't see anyone
 I don't focus in on anyone that I don't roll like that
 I publicly speak all the time in my classroom
 I'm giving the business
 Did you open the door today because I was giving somebody the business you thought I was? I was giving somebody a business
 I was given a two kids who didn't do some work, the business, and you will in my class Monday, I was giving people the business
 That's what I do
 I probably speak all the time
 Your facial expression has nothing to do with what's coming out of my mouth
 I'm horny when I'm talking to your mind of the anointed
 I'm teaching you a principle that's gonna lead to promotion in your future
 So if you don't wanna listen to the word in the season that it comes because of whatever is going on in your life, you're demonstrating a natural in maturity that's going to toss you the opportunity toe
 Have a quality in your tomorrow
 So when you need the authority that God is giving you open the door that the devil is closed, then there's gonna be a question
 I don't know if I have the power to do it
 And what do Children do when they don't have the power to do it? They quit the game
 So now we're not even asking for those lessons Were asking God to give us the strength to live under someone else's authority
 Help me to live in this house where these people mistreat me
 Help me to be on this job that I really don't like
 Help me to stay in this relationship That's driving me crazy
 You're not even manipulating the relationship
 You're asking God for grace, and then you go to church and sing about Greece when you should be focusing on favor
 Why? Because the law taught us all step on the line, pay the consequences
 Oh, you think I made that up? Jump back in the scripture, it says
 So when your childish you have to be under tutors, you have to be under governors until the time authority is appointed by the father
 Even so, we when we were Children In our maturity we were in bondage under the elements of the world
 We were told by the world What? You don't have an education doing making big money in this country without some training
 Awesome education
 You will live at the poverty line
 I can't claim all the spirituality you want
 You ain't got no job
 The government takes care of you
 You blame, not flinch
 Say something will snatch this house up right from under you
 Have you at the shelter and idea you can pretty Oh God, please help me
 The Lord's like for real right now prejudging telling me about a prosper I told him what to do in this season
 I told him the focus
 I told him what to do
 I opened doors for me to go to school
 But they treat the school the way they treat the church
 They treat the training the way they treat the ministry
 Who Lord help me up in here, Fu Because this is the word
 So the Bible says when the fullness of the time was come God sent forthis son made of a woman Look at how he writes it
 And Jesus in the flesh had to be under the law
 Jesus in his flesh had to be under the law
 But if you think that the law don't apply to you, you better read that verse because the law applied to Jesus
 He's just gonna bring Jesus
 Didn't say you know what? I'm gonna skip school making this diploma
 He was like, I just don't get a diploma and went up in the Temple of 12
 Baffling
 I'm like, No, no, no
 You misinterpreted that Scripture
 The original little label
 Like we've never seen a 12 year old like this
 And his mother was like, Where are you? I'm a whoop
 You
 You ever walk off on a Megan? But I was taking care
 My father's business
 Read it
 It's in the Bible, just like that
 They were looking for Jesus
 Remember? They couldn't find him
 You'll ever read that in the Gospel? You have spent that much time in the Bible
 You read it and they couldn't find him
 Remember? He was during a feast
 He was up there
 He was talking to the rabbis and priests and the mother father were mad
 And he said, Don't you know have to be about another visit
 If they don't get flipped, don't get
 But I know that's why I didn't think they was back in them days because it would have said and Jesus received a weapon
 That's what it would have said
 Hey, spank if the divine And they know it was something else in the name of Jesus
 It says so to redeem them that weren't of the law, that see, see what the world says to redeem them, to go back and get people that were under the consequences of the rules that they broke
 Are you read it with me that we might receive the what? Adoption So that we could come into the kingdom and receive the authority
 And because you are sons, God sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts So you could say, God help me to accomplish your purpose
 Oh, you're reading of our seven with me
 Wherefore thou art no more servant
 You're not a servant, Euros
 Your son, your daughter
 You're not a servant
 You're not somebody that is dependent on the grace of God to get you through your hard times
 You're a son
 It's your job to make the kingdom prosper It's not your job to use the church to make it through your heart times It's your job to propel the church through art Listen, we got we got a job to do We got people to reach, We got ministries, We got songs to sing We have goals
 Don't let your personal life slows down because the wheels are moving on this bad boy
 You win it, you win, you win it
 You'll know what I'm talking about because it's written right there
 Wherefore you're not a servant, Your son, your dada and you're an heir of God through Christ Christianity all back on the handout Christianity is to be viewed as an eternal inheritance
 The blessings of creation and life are directed
 It redeemed humanity
 All the blessings in the kingdom are available for church people who have been redeemed
 Look at you never say I know that I don't deserve it
 But God said I'm worth it
 Being born again is a symbolic expression off our relationship to God spiritually, not just naturally
 So when you're born again off the water and the spirit, what you're saying is God Now I'm ready to grow up in your kingdom
 I want a mature so I can take care of the business that you would have to take care of
 And the greater the ministry, the greater the reward
 My ministry's above my legacy
 So really, what I'm focused on in this life is maturing to the point where God can use me in the church to be a witness to others to be
 Are you a motivational? Begins to Deacon's
 Want to do what you do? Are you a motivational speaker? Do they want you when you when you are in the pulpit ministering? Do people say I want to be as faithful? Is that brother or do they look at you like that's brother? Be preaching, but you don't be
 What do people say about you in this place? No, no, no, no
 That's Bible study
 What do they say? What do they say? It doesn't matter
 Only God can judge me
 We know that that's not where you want to be
 Silly
 The judgment of God according to spiritual law
 You don't want to be there
 Take a look
 Why? Because here's what I could see
 This is what happens when we get the only God can judge me
 That's when it's I can claim every blessing I can
 I know all them songs
 I listen to the CD's I hear it
 Listen, I I was I got to do is read me a Scripture on social media and God has spoken to May
 I was flipping through my pages and it said today you're gonna prosper, tap it and share and you were impossible and I tapped in and shared it
 Where's my prosperity? You still ain't got a job today
 If I hit the button and like it five times, I'm gonna get my healing
 You can't even afford a prescription
 That foolishness, that ridiculous religious attitude that makes people that aren't saved laugh at us
 But these Children, immature kids playing in the kingdom
 Look at this parable, the prodigal son prodigy
 It means people that are extravagant, lavish, given to a luxury
 It's see, that's what I like
 I can have whatever I want from God because I'm a Christian when in truth, when you find somebody that understands the value of wealth, what they're saying to you is I can have what I want, but I only get what I need
 I don't know what I'm talking about
 Look, 15 Chapter 11 this is the parable
 And he said a certain man had two sons
 The younger of them said to his father, Father, I cleaned my blessing in the name of Jesus Christ
 I cleaned my husband
 I clean my wife
 I clean my healing
 I clean my desk, I cleaned my car, lowers God bless her family
 No one's gonna help my Children
 Who's gonna help? This is gonna come of that
 But I But I got things to do
 I don't need to be around here, which I got
 I'm busy and he said, Give me the portion of goods that give me all the things that the Bible says I should have
 And the father said, All right, you got that? Gave it to him
 Not many days after the youngest son got all those gathered together, took his journey to a far country
 He wasted his substance with riotous living
 Yes, I'm Hi
 I'm spiritually I'm praying
 I'm talking about all the goodness of the good Lord
 But if the Lord is so good, why you gotta have a relationship with somebody that don't know nothing about the Lord laying up in bed with him
 It's not so good
 Why you need the nightclub
 The Lord so good to you
 Oh, it's so good to you
 Why do all the things that you know the Bible's like notto mess with that? No matter how come you need all those things, If the Lord is so good to you, I do
 I have your attention for a little while you are
 You're following along with this because this is the Bible
 This is This is my job to help you mature in the kingdom
 It's not to make you feel good
 It's to tell you, get in shape, listen to what he says here
 And when he spent all there are rows like in every society there rose a famine
 There's never enough for everybody
 And like anybody else, he had once take a look at this chart right here
 No, but we preached about on Sunday is the demonic in the divine
 Last week we talked about the demonic we talked about what prince of what's what spirits, how they want, because what spirits do is they get you when you're young and they raise you
 So when you don't find your way in Christ, you have already developed a pattern of thinking that is leading you in the wrong direction
 So God a signs preachers that speak against what the demonic has touched was right
 The preachers like, don't come in here with a bad attitude
 The preacher's gonna say that the bridge is going to say, Listen, if you're involved in ministry, you gotta be, is faithful to the ministry, as Marines are to their right lift
 The pressure is going to tell you that he's so insensitive, what the Marine guys like
 Well, if you don't listen to me, they're gonna shoot you in the head and the people on your job, like if you don't listen to me, you're gonna lose your job
 And the preacher saying, If you don't do this God's way, you're not going to get a promotion, and the next season you're gonna be going through this until the Lord comes back
 The demonic demons want to make you feel empowered
 That's what they do
 Demons make you feel like it
 Short turn
 Everything that has been devil is done to, you know, get it demons want to make you feel like you can rebuke them and roll this window
 They want to make you feel so powerful
 That's why people get all excited when the preacher start talking about the devil
 Sometimes I say Satan wants to breach a break
 I can't wait to get it the devil
 But then when you like but the flash working on the flesh people like any, like, two paragraph to get through the flesh All I could do is the devil
 All I gotta say, the devil is a liar
 He's a liar
 He called me poor, but he wasn't lying that time
 Comey trifling
 He was telling the truth
 He couldn't even even know to say it
 He was like You kind of trifling dropping the kind of was the lie Demonic demons want you to feel empowered
 The Divine Angels, God's spirit
 I want you to feel able capable
 Monix, you This is your right
 This is your chance to be in charge
 The divine is have the ability to help
 Help me to be connected
 Look what the bottle says Luke
 20 to 25 He said
 Unto them the kings of Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they they exercise authority upon them are called benefactors
 Because when you have people that work for you, you get the benefit of their labor
 But you shall not be so
 Let he That has the greatest among you with one that says they have all the ability to talent
 They so smart
 Let them serve
 Let him be like a younger
 Let him be like, let him serve for whether he's greater, who's greater, the person that eats the food or the person that knows how to cook it
 My Jesus Here is Jesus here for you to be like all judges
 Or did he come to save you? Did he come toe pull you out of your He had to go through what she went through in order to give you what you need
 He didn't skip the cross to talk to you and give you all the mental information he suffered
 So you understand why suffering to do a job matters
 The demonic wants you to feel important
 That's why when you know the demonic thing is Oh, yeah, I know you don't You don't respect what I'm doing
 I won't do it
 see what happens when I don't do it
 Watch what happens when I step away
 Watch what happens when I'm not there
 All right, go ahead When somebody else is doing it, you kind of working
 You don't support that, cause that See how demonic makes you feel like you're in Bordeaux
 The divine makes willing the divine says important or not
 What do you need me to d'oh When your divine you can have the greatest gift and do the smallest work when you're important, How did some people won't do? And we preached about it a week ago or two won't do the smallest things and don't understand how that little thing you didn't do has caused you to be a nasty person in the future
 The little things balance you the humble
 You don't throw away the little things for 73 5 says if a man doesn't know how to carry himself when he's away from the church, if she doesn't know how to carry herself when she's away from the church, how do you show up in the church with so much talking and all that? If you don't know, this is why there's a way that you have to conduct yourself
 You're a married man
 You can't be in your house acting all he even and then come up in the church like bless everybody
 You can't be in a sheet like boy
 I will cut your throat and stop your neck
 Tell you don't move no more
 And I mean to try to put your heads together
 Put your feet up on the floor
 Just know something
 Nobody that you can't do that you messed it up
 Two minds makes you crazy
 You can't do that
 You can't be talking about
 They're like racism are prominent racism
 I raise other racism and being a church, like, uh, we are one under the Lord
 We're together
 We all got Children
 You sound bananas
 See, the Bible says you have to understand when it says rule your house
 It means you're thinking it means your behavior
 It means your family not being a novice
 There's no blessing when you're inexperienced
 There's no blessing when you have control over yourself
 Listen to me
 Listen to the preacher
 Listen
 Hey, Will Don't understand one of them
 I'm listening
 What? I'm telling you all in here
 One of the worst things you can do to yourself is attack other people in the church
 That happens when you get away with it in the world
 When you start attacking people in the church, let me tell you something
 You're gonna find out real quick
 Oh! Oh, what you mean I while you laying me off? How come I have less hours? You're gonna see how quickly God's like
 You don't ever get to the point where you can't get Show yourself
 You just you're gonna be Your temper's gonna do you better in the church
 You better throw it in neutral
 You're doing attack people in the church
 You mess with us
 He was no matter how mad they get you, the Bible says, let him walk upon you
 So what, You're not attacking people? The consequences
 Not a novice, less less being lifted up with pride
 You fall into the sea
 What that says When you're inexperienced, when you have no control of your temper, you fall into the condemnation of the devil
 Moreover, you have to have a good report of them, which are without unless you fall into a reproach to stay at the devil, see what it says
 Witty
 If they have to go report just in the church
 What does the word say? Come on
 Open your eyes to stay with me, you have to have a good report
 Where? Oh, you have to have a good report in the church
 You have to have a good report
 Where? Oh, they got you now you got a good report and the judge has to go over well outside the church
 Signs of spiritually maturity
 A sense of entitlement to natural blessings before sewing and reaping the seeds of ministry
 That's a maturity God's gonna give me
 Not until you've week
 We preached about it
 Not until you've gone through
 You don't get blessed if you always exit when things get tough
 You don't get blessed when you step away from your ministry so you can get your life together
 Whoever told you that they lied
 You have to go do when you're sick
 You have to go do when things ain't right at home
 You have to go doing the professor didn't treat you right
 You gotta go doing the government took all your taxes because you didn't pay some 100 years ago
 you got to go doing the collectors of chasing you, You gotta go
 Bo doh doh doh doh! And in the charge, you still got to be faithful and nobody better know that you're going through
 I'm telling you how it works because you want to give you what you want to be mature
 No accountability signs of spiritual maturity
 No accountability in the church that that the find your purpose and provides discipline
 Listen, this is what happens
 Everybody becomes this special messenger off God with no accountability
 Listen, Special Messenger Did you bring the macaroni and cheese Special Messenger? Did you open the door? It was you late
 Special messenger
 Well, you wanna pray line when you said you're gonna be in a hairline? Special messenger
 Did you think this Although you like I don't let alone on the words Special message Special one
 What kind of mature? You know what happens
 This is the beauty of being involved in ministry
 People will say to you
 Listen, you just acted like Super Chicken
 You don't want to do this because you're scared you're gonna fail
 Trust me
 We already know you're gonna fail
 We're gonna be here to help you
 You don't make some mistakes
 Failures, Okay? It's when you're afraid of failure
 Things don't go the way they should go
 It's when you create this idea in the church that people shouldn't be able to tell you about yourself
 And then when they tell you about yourself, you're telling them about themselves
 Well, when they pointed to you, wanted somebody else see, How could that? That's That's good
 That's good growth I've never get
 The ministers are like Let's hit
 I was teaching ministers about how to stay in the seven minutes somebody went over
 They all came in office because we huddled up and they're like, Brother, Brother, seven minutes
 You add some minister that it's not seven anymore
 It's basic math
 You add some minutes, not seven anymore
 I was brought
 You was long
 Imagine that brother like, but the anointed was on me and the people were blessed
 And when the pastor imagine that like whoa, But we have to duff that brother
 But we wouldn't know what we would say, brother
 Listen, we're just telling you, you know, But you know, then they said then they come the past
 What we gonna do with the brother
 This didn't really happen
 I'm saying this all works nothing
 You just pray because failure is okay
 And then what happens is when you realize that the things you're doing, a cost in you and God will show you quick
 He'll send somebody in your ministry to tell you first
 Then he'll let you slip up twice
 Then the Lord, like I find will do it again
 Handle yours
 That's why there's some people have been in the church years and years and years and years
 Don't got no money
 Still don't got no peace
 Still don't got no joy
 Stelling got no faithfulness and have them special ministries where they run out and do things for God
 But if a group of people were like, Let's say you didn't do your job Listen, where's your favorite is Let's say that you're part of team
 They don't know nothing about that because they're spiritually immature, James says
 Even so, faith if you don't put your good works behind it, it's dead all by itself
 Yea, a man say vow has faith
 I have works
 Show me thy faith without works and I'll show you what the Lord did
 That's why
 Listen, I hope you'll appreciate the fact that I'm the type of preacher
 I'm not telling you what I think
 I don't have to be like in the future
 I'll see
 God, I'm like Nana
 I've been where I've been
 I've gone
 I've gone and I know that it gets better
 It gets better because the man is living it
 I'm not just talking
 I'm living it
 I'm giving it
 I'm living it
 I'm working on it
 I read my Bible
 I study
 I stay focused
 I pray for me all
 Text me in five
 In the morning
 I take you right back because I'll go down there
 Brady to I'm not telling you to do something I didn't do
 No one in your ministry should be expecting you to do something they didn't do
 That's why what people need
 I'm finishing the y'all need to understand
 I'm almost at the bottom
 Pay attention to things that I'm teaching you
 That's why when you were in ministry, the best thing you can do is share responsibility
 Somebody want to talk about how it is, but I hear you do it for a little while
 That'll shut him up, quack
 Oh, yeah
 No, no
 No people to tell you what Why don't you do it? You plan it
 And don't say it like you do it
 You limit that it, uh, say like no
 Seriously
 And you shouldn't have to say, because that's how all ministry should be
 Run
 You do it
 Come on
 Help! Because when your name is on it, how you'll see there's a different sense
 And when it falls down, that thing will trouble you, Make you pray, make you get down on your knees in the morning like you need to bless these people cause bored living doing Jesus
 I know you love him
 I don't wanna talk about him to you like that, You know, You look, you know me
 I never had to have her
 You don't have a knife
 Just you always about yourself
 When you involve the ministry, you be praying for the team
 You don't know what I'm talking about
 I'm talking about spirit from a chart
 I'm talking about the prodigal son prodigy getting out abundance
 So take a look
 It says so
 He went and he joined himself to a citizen because he had all of the inheritance
 But he decided that he was gonna be extra special and go out and create his own
 And he didn't need the inheritance
 He was gonna build his own Super Ministry That was gonna work out
 And everybody was going to celebrate all his talents and abilities
 And then he found out quick that it doesn't work that way
 You gotta be accountable
 You gotta have discipline
 Somebody has to train you
 So he joined himself to a citizen of that country and they sent him into the fields to feed the pigs
 And he would have filled his belly with the husk that the swine did
 He was so broken, he was going to eat the food that the pigs eat and no man gave unto him
 And when he came to himself, he said, How many people do I know that air in God's house? That Aaron, My father's health that have bred enough to spare
 And I'm out here perishing with hunger
 Take a look
 Let's go right back to it
 The demonic will always unequally yoked Q demonic peop
 Listen to me very carefully
 Team monitor
 The devil will always it's in you Resist way, you will always connect with somebody that is worldly
 If you don't guard your mind, you don't have time to be connected with people that don't have God first in their life
 You don't have time to be falling in love with people that don't have got first in their life
 You don't have time to be making best friends with people that you just don't have time
 They're not eating what you're eating, and you know the first thing that happens when things start to get really like you know you're going to because it's a natural process
 You're in the church and it shouldn't be all butter and gravy in the church
 It should be a journey in a struggle, right? And you're in the church and you're like every people returns are not perfect
 I believe that's why we need Jesus
 Nobody likes me, me to who and I'm preaching in the pulpit
 Sometimes I feel like people don't like me
 I'm saying when I come out, somebody's like Oh, he comes See, we was all out here showing he by looking I know his communion Here comes you don't think I feel like that
 Then it would be like and that's how you are
 Then I get in a car like me what you think about what I said? She said you said what the lawyer told you to say
 What you worried about? I'm like, What? What happened then? Didn't he come? Somebody joking? It was like just kicked him in the face
 It don't look so hot
 You got him, brother
 I'm like it wasn't I was because if you get what I'm fruity preaches presents for you
 Blessings for you blessings
 Let me lay my hands on you so you can feel this Blessing and Ugo right out in the bed of fornication
 20 minutes later
 Then the mayor got to come with the anointing scream and holla in touch your feelings
 Yeah, I don't know, because it's got to be an equal yoke
 You gotta be
 Can you? It's better to be connected with people and struggle with those people and have those people be like now you can't do that
 You said you're gonna do it
 Come on and do it now
 You don't have the right attitude
 The divine gives you strong connections
 That's why Secondly, 6 14 you reading it
 It says, Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers
 For what? Fellowship has people that are trying to do things the right way with people that are trying to do things their own way
 How can you possibly be getting love advice from somebody that's not in the church, sleeping with their man or their girlfriend? How can you be in the middle of their relationship? How can you begin information about all that? Just feeding your head? How can you be talking to people that are time hustling, stealing? Do a criminal work? How can you be? Listen to these people
 How can you be in office talking about all the racism, the crying, the distant death? How can you let this up? Listen, I don't know, Daddy
 My problems
 I'm glad I'm about God's business
 How can you be connected to that and grow amateur? I'm preaching it in here demonic
 Be Monica
 People think they work for God
 They think they have a gift and they made Jews it to bless God
 That's what do you want
 People think they think they're like good preachers and they preach and God use them
 I don't work for God
 Oh, I do, bro
 Does the broom is not like I am super broom
 When? When? When? When God comes to get the one room steps out Like I don't want them on the brooms
 I'm the best
 No, you're no more than the broom
 Your clay, You dirt your dust
 You have to know you
 You don't work for God
 You work with God
 He works to you, John
 15 14
 He says you're my friends
 If you do what I command you henceforth I don't call you servants for the servant Doesn't know what the Lord is doing
 But I call you friends
 I told you what to focus on in my kingdom
 For all those things I heard of my father, I made known unto you
 You choose
 May I know you do came the church and you came in here like I want to be saved
 No, you did it
 I told you I touched first
 I sent the witness
 I sent the word
 I gave you the inspiration
 I chose you, Po and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and your fruit should what remain so the things that the the life that you build should be steady
 It shouldn't be sometimes erupt
 Sometimes you down
 Sometimes you can't
 Sometimes you can't
 Sometimes you're on
 Sometimes you they sometimes your church, and then sometimes you're not
 Sometimes you come in, and sometimes you don't
 That's not how God works whatsoever
 You asking the father, he said
 I'm gonna give it to you
 Unequal yolks weaken you
 They don't threaten you
 Deep connections to people who aren't attached to the ministry and God's people, and the people that God has assigned you will drain your talent and blessings
 Your attachment has to be to the people that you work within the ministry
 That's why you don't drop any ministry, whatever team you're working on, work on that team would assigned work on that team who love a sweeping whoever's vacuuming
 Whoever's cleaning whoever's Brick in whoever's cooking who have us playing when it's your time to be on that team, do your job on that team so God can mature
 You look at this, see what they see with the, uh, the product he had
 He had to go and eat a pig's food because he walked away when The Lord showed me that I was like, Oh, pigs
 It's a metaphor
 They eat anything
 You can drop a dead body in a pig trough
 It will be gone in the morning
 Pigs eat anything
 It was on the table, but now it's in the trash
 The spirit of the pig is to eat messages and teaching that we're prepared for other people's ministry
 But it disconnected from your purpose and fell off the table
 That's why when people are not connected to ministry, they love every message that's on television
 YouTube
 They point
 They eat that stuff up
 It don't mean nothing to them pain and the people's churches
 Oh, the preacher's sad dance, he said
 That I claimed about, I was reading What does that have to do with you? What you a pig eating somebody else's trash? That's what you do, you know, when you finish your scrape your plates in a big That's what some people do
 That's why they know every message that was preaching some from the church that they go to
 That's why they believe everything that the big preachers say he out in Los Angeles, pastor in a whole different group, of people just in his leftovers
 You can't What Lord is prepared for you Because you're not mature enough to go to the table
 Sit down like you got good sense in E
 So you gotta go out
 And you you gotta eat what Noel Jones had and what it's like those of good messages
 But then you don't have any ministry over there
 You try to take what they saying that applied over here like you
 Super duper opa spatula like gods like not let me hook them up
 I'm over Los Angeles
 Let me get this measures to Boston
 And you believe that? I turned on my radio, I put on the phone And then he came
 I was flipping through the Facebook and I saw the message, and it just touched me all up in my spirit when you were trapped on Sunday
 No
 Why? Because I'll run around my friends
 But the lawyer back up
 Oh, just eating it
 It's garbage
 Pig Ford
 So how you live in somebody else's trash? You serving in that ministry? You working in that church? You're seeing that quiet? You're helping out Youth ministry
 You work with those kids? No, regardless of mistakes
 Always find your way back to the table that God has prepared for you
 You got to go back to the table
 You You're not a child
 I don't want to eat that
 I want a I want to go to make panels
 So we all need to grow up in the Mitchell house
 You go back because the word that God gives you is connected to the ministry and the inheritance that he has for you
 And when you get there, you better remember who you are
 Don't come back with that
 I went through this and I went through that
 Let me share with Sean
 What? I went through what I went through
 We don't want to hear all that
 We got work to do
 You ready to do it? Christianity is to be viewed as an internal inheritance
 You have to mature
 You have to have mature behaviors
 You have to be a comfortable
 You need other people to hold you to your word
 Father, we thank you
 What? You spoke in tow us
